## Hows it going you salty scallions 🧅 🧅 🧅


For this challenge, we're making a custom radio button and toggle selector. It might sound simple but if you'll
soon find out styling radio buttons can be quite the challenge. Based on which option is selected you will change the card's photo.

## Steps 🐾 🐾 🐾

First, figure out the structure you're going to build with, deciding which element will be a component.

Second, start thinking about how you're going to hold your state. There's not going to be a lot of state with
this challenge, about the size of New York State. (I'll leave now...)

Lastly, put it all together and render it to your page!

## Requirements for Success

- You need to be able to toggle between both options with a visual queue that shows which is selected
- Your radio button needs to be styled (don't skimp on this one, really good learnings here)
- our selection should change the photo and background-color
